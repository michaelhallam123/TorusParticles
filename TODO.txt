BEFORE RELEASE:
-Multithreading for larger ball counts
-Instancing
-CMake

OPTIONAL:

Fix antialiasing so that balls actually touch on collision - may need to alter texture coordinates for this

Also antialiasing still looks somewhat jagged

Allow for screen resizing

Separate physics from framerate (!)

Add gui for easier control of parameters

Speed up simulation using multithreading

Add pause and step through simulation functionality

Add window icon

Solvers:
-QuadTreeSolver
-Deterministic solver

Add fps counter

Cache coefficients in physics computations to try and save time

Add option to specify total kinetic energy plus a direction for total momentum
